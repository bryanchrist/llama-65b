### Response: Question: A theater group is selling tickets to their upcoming production of "The Wizard of Oz." Tickets cost $23 for adults and $17 for children. If the theater group sells 100 tickets total, and they made $3275 total from ticket sales, how many adult tickets did they sell? Solution: def solution():

### Response: Question: It's the 4th of July!  Everyone is out buying fireworks to celebrate!  The State Fire Marshal regulates how much of each type of firework a person can buy.  You can buy a maximum of 3 aerial fireworks (like bottle rockets and firecrackers) and 16 ground-based fireworks (like sparklers or snakes).  The State Fire Marshal is notoriously picky about the rules, and they enforce the limits strictly... so don't even think about buying more fireworks than they say!  If that happens, you could be fined as much as $2,000 or sent to jail for up to 18 months.  So... maybe read the instructions on the fireworks themselves to make sure you only buy what you're allowed.  For example,

### Response: Question: Lana was selling 50 raffle tickets for a fundraiser. 14 of her friends and family bought tickets from her. 23 of her co-workers bought tickets when she brought the tickets with her to the annual holiday party. The day of the raffle, Lana’s boss bought the remaining tickets. One by one, Lana’s co-workers crossed their fingers and looked away as Lana’s boss selected the winner. “The winner is….”  Lana’s boss paused for dramatic effect. Everyone at the company looked at her and waited. She looked up and shouted, “Congratulations, Lana! You won!” Lana was shocked. “Do I get the money, the car, or both?!” she beamed.  “Take the car,” Lana’s boss replied, adding, “And your generous friends and family and co-workers chipped in to pay for the taxes on your winnings!” Lana’s co-workers cheered. She hugged Lana’s boss, hopped in the car, drove it around the parking lot twice, and parked it in her usual spot.  Lana’s boss came outside to give Lana the rest of her winnings and congratulated Lana again.  “I’m only keeping 10% of the ticket proceeds for fundraising costs, you know,” said Lana’s boss. “I’m so glad we were able to raise so much for such a wonderful cause.”  “And, Lana, it looks like the taxes on your prize will only be 25% of the car’s value, so that worked out pretty well for everyone!”  “Thank you!

### Response: Question: Ms. K. has been a teacher for 20 years. She has a bachelor's degree and a master's degree. She took three years to get her bachelor's degree and one and a half years to get her master's degree. One year of school generally takes 30 weeks. Each week of education costs $10. (Scholarships, family support, etc. are ignored.) How much has Ms. K. spent on education? Solution: #Ms. K. spent 30 weeks/year x 3 years/bachelor's degree x $10/week = $900 on her bachelor's degree.
bachelors_degree_cost = 30 * 3 * 10
#and she spent 30 weeks/year x 1.5 years/master's degree x $10/week = $450 on her master's degree.
masters_degree_cost = 30 * 1.5 * 10
